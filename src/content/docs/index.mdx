## Workshop Modules

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Setting Up Performance & Error Monitoring" icon="setting">
    Configure Error Monitoring and Performance Monitoring for your React
    frontend and Node.js backend. Set up Session Replay, structured logging, and
    distributed tracing to catch critical issues before they impact customers
    during peak traffic.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Optimizing Web Vitals" icon="rocket">
    Fix slow-loading images causing poor LCP scores, eliminate CLS from
    conditional banners, and resolve render-blocking page loads with skeleton
    screens. Measure improvements using Sentry's Web Vitals dashboard.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Distributed Tracing & Backend Performance" icon="seti:plan">
    Use distributed tracing to connect frontend slowness to backend bottlenecks.
    Simulate traffic to trigger automatic N+1 query detection, and fix
    performance problems with SQL JOINs and database optimization.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Session Replay & Sentry Logs" icon="document">
    Use Session Replay to identify silent validation failures that block users.
    Combine Session Replay with Sentry Logs to debug checkout issues affecting
    specific user segments like Amex cardholders.
  </Card>
  <Card title="AI-Powered Debugging & Production Readiness" icon="seti:config">
    Configure alerts to catch performance regressions and errors. Build
    dashboards to monitor key metrics, and set up GitHub integration to enable
    AI-powered debugging capabilities.
  </Card>
