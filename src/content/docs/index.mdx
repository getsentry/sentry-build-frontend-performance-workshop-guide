## Workshop Modules

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Performance & Error Monitoring Setup" icon="setting">
    Set up comprehensive Sentry monitoring for your React frontend and Node.js
    backend. Configure error tracking, Web Vitals monitoring, Session Replay,
    and alerting to catch critical issues before they impact customers during
    peak traffic.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Optimizing Performance with Web Vitals" icon="rocket">
    Identify and fix performance bottlenecks using Web Vitals (LCP, TTFB, INP).
    Optimize slow authentication flows, implement custom performance metrics,
    and use Sentry's Seer AI to get automated fix suggestions for performance
    issues.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Distributed Tracing & Backend Impact" icon="seti:plan">
    Link frontend slowness to backend performance issues using distributed
    tracing. Debug slow product searches, identify N+1 queries, optimize
    database calls, and understand end-to-end request flows from browser to
    database.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Session Replay & Production Readiness" icon="document">
    Use Session Replay to debug user experience issues and understand checkout
    failures. Set up performance alerts, create custom dashboards for holiday
    traffic monitoring, and integrate Slack notifications to catch degradations
    in real-time.
