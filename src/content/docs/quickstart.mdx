Follow this guide to get up and running with the workshop environment in the fastest way possible.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher)

Additionally, you'll need a Sentry account to follow along with the tracing and monitoring portions of this workshop:

- [Sign up for a free Sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/) if you don't already have an account

:::tip[Pro Tip]
We recommend setting up two separate projects in your Sentry account: one for the frontend (React) and one for the backend (Node.js). This allows you to efficiently monitor each project more clearly. We'll be configuring our SDKs in the workshop, so all you need to do is create the new projects and have your DSN's handy.

## Setup Instructions

<Steps>
1. **Fork the repository**

     Go to [https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-build-ai-workshop](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-build-ai-workshop) and click the "Fork" button in the top right. We'll do this instead of simply cloning the repo because we'll demo features of AI agent, Seer which can open PRs to fix code for us.

2. **Leave the fork network**

   Go to the settings of your forked repo, scroll all the way down to the Danger Zone, click "Leave fork network", and follow the prompts to convert your forked repo into a standalone repo, all nice and isolated from the original.

   <ScaledImage

   />

3. **Then, clone your fork:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sentry-build-ai-workshop.git
   ```

4. **Navigate to the project directory**

   ```bash
   cd sentry-build-ai-workshop
   ```

5. **Install dependencies with PNPM**

   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

6. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   touch apps/frontend/.env
   echo "VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api" >> apps/frontend/.env
   ```

   ```bash
   touch apps/server/.env
   echo "PORT=3001" >> apps/server/.env
   cd apps/server
   ```

7. **Database Setup**

   We'll be using [NeonDB](https://neon.new/) for this workshop, so we need to set up the database. Navigate to the `apps/server` directory and run the following commands and select the defaults when prompted:

   ```bash
   pnpx neondb -y
   ```

8. **Seed the Database**

   ```bash
   pnpm db:generate
   pnpm db:push
   pnpm db:seed
   ```

9. **Start the Project (from the root)**

   ```bash
   cd ../..
   pnpm dev
   ```

10. **Access the application project**

    The project will now be running:
    - with the frontend running on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
    - with the backend API running on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

</Steps>

## What's Available After Setup

Once you've completed the setup, you'll have access to:

- A Vite-powered React frontend running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- A Node.js backend API running at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
- Full-stack JavaScript application ready for Sentry instrumentation

This setup will allow you to progress through the workshop and start implementing Sentry. This workshop will take you through setting up **Error Monitoring, Logging, Tracing**, and building visualizations in dashboards!
